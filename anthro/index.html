      <h2>
        Our platform is a non-profit, website-based organization that seeks to promote awareness of and adherence to principles of Security, Consent, and Education in the usage of AI within the field and industries of medicine.
      </h2> 
      <p>
        Our Security algorithm trawls AI platforms and scours for misused data from patients who may or may not have consented to have their digital social identifiers and content used for training AI.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our Consent pledge form creates a singular space in which both doctors and patients can opt in OR out of usage of their data in AI education, and specify exactly what uses they prefer if they do choose to opt-in.  We have also created a notarized document service for providers to sign swearing and indemnifying that they do OR do not use AI technology to diagnose patients, and that they do OR do not use patients’ data in the training or usage of AI.  Our hope is that one day, through legislation, this form will be a generic part of the Patient’s Bill of Rights that is required by law to be posted in every office of medicine, and a routine part of patient paperwork.

      </p>

      <p>
        Our Education page contains information on up-to-date studies regarding the both positive and adverse effects of using AI in medicine, from diagnostics to treatment.  It also hosts a Community Forum, in which users can share information with each other on an encrypted platform where you can guarantee your vulnerable medical information can be safely expressed or transmitted to other patients.  We have also created a Provider Directory, in which patients can be matched with registered providers based on their individual needs for bedside manner, cultural background, languages spoken, and intensity of care, etc., in addition to just speciality.
